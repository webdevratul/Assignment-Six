            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Var:</h2>
            <p>Function-scoped or globally scoped (if defined outside of a function) are the two options for scope.</p>
            <p>Hoisting: Variables declared with the var keyword are raised to the top of the global or function scope
                in which they are used. This implies that you have access to them even before they are declared in the
                code.</p>
            <p>Re-declaration: Variables declared using the var keyword can be redeclared without causing any issues
                inside the same scope.</p>
            <p>Re-declaration: Variables declared using the var keyword can be redeclared without causing any issues
                inside the same scope.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Let:</h2>
            <p>Variable hoisting: Let-declared variables are hoisted but not initialized. If you attempt to access them
                prior to their declaration, you will see a "Temporal Dead Zone" error.</p>
            <p>Re-declaration: Let-declared variables are not permitted to be declared again within the same scope.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Const:</h2>
            <p>Const variables are hoisted but not initialized, similar to let variables. If accessed before
                declaration, this results in a "Temporal Dead Zone" problem.</p>
            <p>Re-declaration: After initialization, variables declared with const cannot be re-declared or reassigned.
            </p>
            <p>Const variables cannot be changed, however if they are an object or an array, they can still have their
                attributes or elements changed.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">undefined:</h2>
            <p>A primitive value called "undefined" represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been given a
                value.</p>
            <p>Use Cases:-</p>
            <p>once a variable has been declared but not yet given a value. <br>
                as the function parameter's default value. <br>
                when a component of an array or an object doesn't exist.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">null:</h2>
            <p>null is also a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any value or an empty value.
            </p>
            <p>Use Cases:-</p>
            <p>when you want to show that a variable or property should be empty or is being used on purpose. <br>
                whenever you want to empty a variable or property.</p>

            What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>"Representational State Transfer" (REST) is an acronym for "Representational State Transfer," and a REST
                API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of guidelines and conventions for creating and
                utilizing web services that follow these guidelines. REST is an architectural design approach for
                creating stateless client-server interactions in networked systems, especially web services.</p>
